                    <h3>OUR PHILOSOPHY</h3>
                    <h4>Doing good is a state of mind that can accompany every action and shine through every thought.
nav-logo-link
                        Doing good starts from within, so even the smallest action can help the planet we all inhabit.
                        Ultimately, we believe that a critical mass of people who want good, think good,
                        and do good can generate positive transformation in the world. The crucial moment to start is
                        now!</h4>

                    <p><strong>The natural world is under threat.</strong> In the Amazon, more than 150 acres of
                        rainforest are lost every minute of every day.
                        Populations of mammals, birds, fish, amphibians, and reptiles have seen an alarming average drop
                        of 68% since 1970. And this isn't just about the natural world - it's about our world as well.
                        We depend on nature for our own survival, livelihoods, happiness, and as seen with COVID-19, our
                        health - the destruction of nature only increases the chances of future pandemics emerging.
                        Our broken relationship with nature is putting the future of people and the planet at risk.

                        <strong>But humanity is waking up...and stepping up.</strong>
                        A growing number of people around the world are concerned about humanity's relationship with
                        nature, changing their ways, and demanding more action to protect the planet.
